# About Me

<br />Hello there! I am Cláudio Gonçalves, a Junior Backend Engineer currently working @Uphold. Personally, my interests are pretty much all over the place. I am curious about multiple topics and concepts, ranging from Software engineering to table-top games. <br />
Professionally, you could expect me to be excited about cryptocurrencies and code organization principles. I am a young engineer, so expect me to be curious and enthusiastic about software construction and architecture. I'm always eager to learn more, so if you want to have a conversation about Computer Science or other topics that I am interested in, send me an [email](mailto:claudiofilipesilvagoncalves@gmail.com). <br />
Personally, outside of work, I usually go out, travel, go to coffee shops and play Magic: The Gathering at an LGS in Braga. You could expect me to be a sore loser but loving to play the game. <br />
Finally, career-wise, I want to become a Senior Engineer in the following years and lead a team. So, expect this blog to be a notebook to track my progress as an engineer. As of now, if you want to check my progress and career path on the road to my final goal, you can check my [resume]({{ site.url }}/download/resume-claudio.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
