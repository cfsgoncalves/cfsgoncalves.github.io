# About me

Hello there. My name is Cláudio Gonçalves, a software engineer currently working for Uphold, as a Junior Backend Engineer.
Personally, my interests are pretty much all over the place. I am curious about multiple topics and concepts. <br />
So, professionally, you could expect me to be enthusiastic about cryptocurrencies and code organization principles. Scaling, mainting and creating software and team are the topics that I am most interested about. How can you make the difference in a company is another. <br />
On the other hand, regarding my free time I usually play Magic: The Gathering and chess. In spike of liking to compete in each of this games, I am usually not a great player. Althought sometimes you can find me playing in an LGS in Braga.
