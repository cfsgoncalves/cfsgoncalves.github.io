# About Me

<br /> Hello there! I am Cláudio Gonçalves, a Software Engineer currently working @Truphone. Personally, my interests are pretty much all over the place. I am curious about multiple topics and concepts, ranging from Software engineering to tabletop games. <br />
Professionally, you could expect me to be excited about tech in general, psychology, and physics. I am always eager to have a great conversation and have a heated debate with anyone that wants to pursue a nice discussion of topics. <br />
Personally, outside of work, I usually go out, travel, go to coffee shops, and play Magic: The Gathering at an LGS in Braga. You could expect me to be a sore loser but loving to play the game.  <br />
Finally, career-wise, I don't know where I want to stop, but always want to make technical decisions and discuss trade-offs. So, expect to have most of the time an opinion. Even when I am wrong, I don't care, I just use most of the interactions to learn something new. Expect this blog to be a notebook to track my conclusions and lessons learned. As of now, if you want to check my career and my experiences, you can check my [resume]({{ site.url }}/download/resume-claudio.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
